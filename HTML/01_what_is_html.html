<!DOCTYPE html> 
        <!-- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
        The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
        In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:   <!DOCTYPE html>    -->

<html>
    <head>
        <!-- meta data -->

        <!-- The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
        HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
        Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information. -->

    </head>
    <body>

        <!-- The <body> tag defines the document's body.

        The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            
        Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document. -->
        
    </body>
